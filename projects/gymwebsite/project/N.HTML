<PRE>To stay fit and maintain your shape a regular workout helps a lot. But when it comes to losing weight and getting back in shape, a regular workout or exercise routine won’t suffice. You will have to take it a step further and take care of your diet in order to lose weight. Even the gym instructors would tell you so. Exercise and diet are the two sides of a coin. You can’t achieve weight loss with just one of them. A regular exercise routine and a healthy diet is your route to salvation.
I’m following a Indian diet myself by a leading dietician. Me, my cousin, some of her friends and a lot of people I know have taken diet from this dietician. And we all have lost a considerable amount of weight to say the least.
You must be thinking that the diets given by the dieticians are personalized then how can we all follow the same diet routine with our different weights and blood groups. For starters, he doesn’t gives the diet according to the blood group. Though, generally the diets given by dieticians are personalized. I have noticed a similarity In the diets given to me and others. And since now, that I know his diets are universal. I’d want YOU, Rati’s lovely readers to reap its fruit as well.
When I first went to this dietician, he told me to get some blood tests done. Like thyroid checkup, blood sugar, serum insulin in my case since I have PCOD. So it’s just not about losing weight but getting to know the underlying reason of piling on the kilos. In my case it was increased serum insulin levels. But in my cousins case all her tests were ok, she was gaining weight because of her erratic routine and the junk food she so loved. So if you think that you are doing everything right but still gaining weight, the first thing you should be doing is finding the underlying reason for it.
First things first, If everything with you is fine your weight gain is due to lethargy, wrong dietary habits and erratic routine. So When u go on a diet make sure that whatever plan u follow it must be timed right as well. You must wake up latest by 8:00 ( that’s for the late risers, even I used to wake up by 10 or 11). This is the most important thing in your routine because the body has its own clock and you shouldn’t mess with it.
This diet is split in 4 weeks period with the diet changing every week.
Before starting the diet weigh yourself and write it down somewhere. This way you know where you started and you feel good to see the scales going down.
Some things you need to follow this diet:
1.	No salt after 7:30
2.	No aerated drinks. Yes that includes even the diet version.
3.	Restrict mango and banana
4.	Restrict potato and rice.
5.	No artificial juices as well.
6.	Half an hour of aerobic exercise daily. If u want to join a gym good enough. But if due to any reason maybe time or money constraint u can’t join a gym. All you need is a comfortable pair of shoes to do some aerobics, a skipping rope to do at least 500 skips (5 sets of 100 skips and increasing it as you go). 1.5 -2 kgs dumbbells for toning your upper body. Just these basic things and you are set.
7.	20 mins of breathing exercise. ( I’m talking about Baba Ramdevs pranayam)
Without further ado I present you with the Indian diet.
 Week 1
8:00 am (as soon as you wake up) – 2 glasses of methi seeds water ( soak 1tsp of methi seeds in 2 glasses of water. Strain out the methi seeds and drink the water. Helps a lot in water retention and bloating) 5 soaked almonds with the skin. 1 kali mirch u don’t have to chew it just swallow it down.

By the end of the month you will definitely lose 3-6 kgs I lost 4.3 kgs in a month with PCOD. I’m sure u can do better.
He also gave me some really good gyan as well. According to him when on a diet your social life won’t stop but you can still manage your weight without locking yourself at home. Some pointers for it. :
1.	When you go out with friends try to have your lunch or dinner at subway. The healthiest option out there. Take a veggie delite sub in brown bread and eating out won’t harm your diet and weight at all. Tell them not to put mayo in it though.
2.	If you don’t have a say in the place of eating then make your choices sensibly. If you go to eat Chinese have rice rather than noodles. Order stir fried veggies instead of Manchurian. And control your proportions. Don’t take fried starters. Avoid those thick soups they are no good.
3.	When going out just pick 2 fruits before sitting in the car and eat it on your way to the venue. When you are already a little filled before going out. Your somewhat filled stomach helps your mind take the right decision.
4.	If eating Indian, order tandoori chappati rather than butter naan or parantha. Take less gravy since it is the most fattening.
Even if you don’t want to lose weight keep these points in your mind and you will be able to maintain your weight easily.
So go on a diet now and get your svelte figure back.
P.S.: I really want to thank Rati for giving me a platform to share my thoughts and ideas without having me to bear with the responsibility of making a whole blog work. Thanks, and I hope I get to write here in future as well.
