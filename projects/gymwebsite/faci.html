<h3 align="center">Why Join Gym</h3>
<p class="para1">As much as we'd like to believe that chocolate cake and ice cream are the elixir for a long and healthy life, we know that's not the case. We also know that a regular exercise routine is one of the surest paths to a longer and healthier life.
The Centers for Disease Control recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderately intense aerobic exercise every week -- but less than half of all Americans do so. And for the millions of people who would like to do better, this is often the time of year to consider joining a gym. We can all find lots of excuses for not getting our bodies in motion, but there's an equally compelling list of reasons why we should do so.
</p><p class="para1">
Whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, tone up or improve your overall health, new year's resolutions are the No. 1 reason people of all fitness levels pony up the bucks and decide to join a conveniently located gym. Here are nine reasons why a gym membership is a really good idea, starting with the most obvious one. (A companion post will provide you with reasons why you should skip the gym and find another way to exercise.)
</p>
<p class="para1">
<b>1. Get Healthy</b>

A gym encourages you to do a balanced program that includes both aerobic and strength training exercises. These promote heart health and weight loss, help prevent osteoporosis and improve muscle strength, balance and flexibility. If weight loss is a primary goal, consider the mantra of a friend who tells me "nothing tastes as good as getting in shape feels."
</p>
<p class="para1"><b>
2. Find Support and Motivation</b>

Some people really enjoy exercise; for others, it's a chore. If you fall into that latter group, being surrounded by other people who are in the same boat can provide the incentive you need to make exercise part of your regular routine. Your initial intention might be to drag yourself to the gym twice a week, but once you find your rhythm, you may end up going on a more regular basis, which will help make your goals more attainable.</p>
<p class="para1">
<b>
3. Get Stress Relief</b>

According to the Mayo Clinic, virtually any form of exercise can act as a stress reliever -- whether you're a serious athlete or an out of shape wannabe. Physical activity boosts the brain's production of endorphins, which simply makes us feel better physically and have a brighter emotional outlook. Exercise reduces tensions in both the body and the mind, which can improve your mood and the quality of your sleep. For many people, the gym becomes a bit of sanctuary where you can turn off the phone and forget all of the troubles at work or in your personal life.
